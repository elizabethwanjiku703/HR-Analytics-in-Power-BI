# HR-Analytics
### Description
- In this Power BI case study, I explored a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs through a course on [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/case-study-hr-analytics-in-power-bi).
- This project focuses on helping me import, analyze, and visualize Human Resources data in Power BI. Building on my existing knowledge of the platform, I learned how to effectively work with Power BI using practical examples.
- Throughout this case study, I conducted exploratory data analysis and utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create powerful visualizations. A key focus was on analyzing employee attrition and identifying the factors that impact it. This analysis will help the organization determine what actions it needs to take to retain more employees.
- I finalized the case study by making design changes to my report, ensuring a clean and branded presentation of the findings.
